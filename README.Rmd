# siera

<!-- badges: start -->

With siera, users ingest Analysis Results Standard - ARS (a CDISC Foundational standard) metadata and auto-generate
R scripts that, when run in with provided ADaM datasets, provide Analysis Results Datasets (ARDs).  

In order to use the readARS() function, users will need to provide the following:

1. A Functional JSON file, representing ARS Metadata for a Reporting Event (to get started, see TFL Designer)
2. An output directory where the R scripts will be placed
3. A folder containing the related ADaM datasets for the ARDs to be generated

## Installation

The current version (0.1.0) of siera can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/clymbclinical/siera) with:

``` {r install}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/clymbclinical/siera", 
                         auth_token = "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")
```


## Example

Using an example JSON ARS file, run readARS() function to produce the ARD programs.

In this example, the following is used:
1. JSON ARS file: CDISC Pilot Study Common Safety Displays JSON ARS.
2. get

```{r example}
library(siera)

json_path <- system.file("extdata", "ARS_V1_Common_Safety_Displays.json", package = "siera")
output_folder <- file.path(paste0(getwd()))
ADaM_folder <- file.path(paste0(getwd(),"/ADAM"))

readARS(json_path, output_folder)
```


What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
